## Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding:

Algorithms differ from each other in their complexity:
    - Different run times for different algorithms based on:
          1. Input Size
          2. Efficieny of the algorithm

#### What is Asymptotic Complexity ?

  The limiting behavior of the execution time of an algorithm when the size of the problem goes to infinity.
  This is usually denoted using the Big-O notation.
  
  There are Asymptotic Time Complexity and Asymptotic Space Complexity.
  
  Concept here is: assuming that we have a large input - we say - one algorithm is faster than the other one.
  
#### What role does Efficiency of an algorithm play ?

   Eventhough we have the technological capacity to deal with huge inputs today. Efficiency is still of paramount concern. 
   
   This is because when things get to cubic complexity, it gets difficult, even for modern day computers, so efficiency comes into play.
    
   Larger the input size - higher concern efficiency becomes.
   

#### What are we concerned about ?

   - Efficient procedures for solving large scale problems.
   - Scalability: We want to be able to track how our algorithms are going to do as inputs grow larger and larger.
   
#### Class Data Structures:
    
    1. BST
    2. Hash Tables (Dictionary)
    3. Balanced Binary Search Tree
    
    These data structures were invented many decades ago but have stood the test of time. 
    They are still useful - we can infact augment these data structures in ways to make them more efficient for certain kinds of problems.
    
    There are also classical algorithms for these data structures - (sorting and matching and so on).
