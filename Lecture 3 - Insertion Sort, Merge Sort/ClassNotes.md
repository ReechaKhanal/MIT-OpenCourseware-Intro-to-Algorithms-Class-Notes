## Insertion Sort and Merge Sort

#### Why Sorting:

    1. Phonebook, Mp3 organizers, spreadsheets â€“ easy to search
    
    2. Many problems become easy once items are sorted
    
            Example: finding a median (the median value) problem
        
    3. Also, Binary Search becomes easier once the elements are sorted. linear to logarithmic
    
    4. Binary Search could be said to be the greatest and simplest paradigm of the 
       divide and conquer algorithm.
       It is an algorithm that can reduce the computational complexity from linear to algorithmmic
       
#### Other Not-So-Obvious advantages of sorting

    1. Data Compression
    
    2. Sort them to find duplicate elements
    
    3. Document Distancing - could be an example of data compression, but it gives you a different 
       representation of the string.
    
    4. Sorting is used as a subrouting in data compression
    
    5. Computer graphics use sorting, most of the times when you render scenes in computer graphics 
       most of the times when you render scenes in computer graphics you have many layers corresponding
       to the scenes.
       
       It turns out that in computer graphics, most of the time you are rendering front to back
       because when you have a big opaque objects in front, you want to render that first,
       so that you dont have to worry about everything that has been blocked by the object.
       
       So, you keep things sorted front to back most of the times in computer graphics, rendering, 
       but some of the time if you are worried about transparency 
       you have to render things back to front.
       
       Typically - you have sorted lists, corresponding to the different objects in both orders
       (increasing and decreasing), and you are maintaining that.
